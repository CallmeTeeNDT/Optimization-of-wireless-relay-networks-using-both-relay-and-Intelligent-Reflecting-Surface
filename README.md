# Optimization-of-wireless-relay-networks-using-both-relay-and-Intelligent-Reflecting-Surface
This is the topic I did for Graduation project.
This project signifies the culmination of my undergraduate studies and stands as a significant academic milestone in my educational journey. As my first experience engaging in theoretical research, this project introduced a series of intellectual challenges and revealed areas in which I still have considerable room for growth. Nonetheless, it also provided a valuable opportunity to expand my academic horizon and engage more deeply with advanced topics in telecommunications. I am especially grateful for the unwavering support and mentorship of my supervisor, Dr. Tran Thanh Phuong, whose guidance at every stage—conceptualization, research, and implementation—was instrumental to the project’s success. I would also like to express my sincere appreciation to Dr. Nguyen Nhat Tan and the faculty members on my final project committee. Their insightful critiques and constructive feedback helped me refine the quality of both the technical content and the written presentation of my work.

Among all the academic projects I have undertaken, this archival research most directly aligns with my specialization in telecommunications. The central focus of the study was built upon the scientific paper titled “Phase Optimization and Relay Selection for Common Relay and IRS-Supported Communication” by U. E. Uyoata, M. Akinsolu, E. Obayiuwana, A. Sangodoyin, and R. Adeogun. This publication served as the theoretical cornerstone of my graduation project, offering a comprehensive framework for exploring intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted communication systems in tandem with relay selection strategies.

My initial phase of work involved a detailed and methodical reading of the reference article, with particular attention paid to the system optimization techniques and mathematical models it introduced. In order to gain a more nuanced and complete understanding, I undertook the derivation and verification of each key formula presented by the authors. This analytical process was critical for solidifying my grasp of core concepts, such as phase shift design and performance trade-offs in IRS-assisted systems, and also served to prepare me for the mid-term evaluation of the project.

Following the mid-term review, I transitioned into the development phase, which encompassed writing the technical report, coding the simulation models, and recreating the analytical results using MATLAB. Given its versatility and comprehensive toolboxes for signal processing and system modeling, MATLAB proved to be an ideal platform for this stage of the work. Through the simulations, I was able to observe how different configurations of IRS placement and relay selection influence the overall communication performance metrics, such as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and system throughput.

Finally, I compiled an evaluation table that synthesized the key findings, illustrating how the joint implementation of IRS and relay nodes can enhance communication efficiency, mitigate signal degradation, and optimize system performance across a range of operating conditions. These insights not only validated the results presented in the original paper but also deepened my appreciation for the complexities and possibilities within next-generation wireless communication systems.
